folk-fill-ammo-ignore=Ammunition types listed here will never be used. List should be comma-separated.\n\nPlease use the items prototype name, and not the translated name shown in the game UI.
folk-fill-ammo-prefer=Ammunition types listed here will be preferred in the order they are listed, with the leftmost being top priority. So if you for example want to minimise use of explosive-type cannon shells, you could put "uranium-cannon-shell, cannon-shell" here. If a preferred ammunition is not available, the mod will use others, unless they are listed in the ignored types.\n\nPlease use the items prototype name, and not the translated name shown in the game UI.
folk-fill-fuel-ignore=Functions as Ignore ammo, read the description there.
